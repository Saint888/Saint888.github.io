    <p class="aboutMe"> Story time! Here, I'll tell you a bit more about myself... on top of the brief interests <br>
      I previously spoke on, I also love playing basketball, collecting sneakers and indulging <br>
      in good food lol.</p>
      <p id="intro">As far as basketball, I've played from middle school to college and <br>
      even had the oppotunity to play pro in Brazil but unfortunately life had other plans. <br>
      When it comes to food, I don't discrimminate; I'm always open to try something new!  <br>
      Lastly, my interest in sneakers and even fashion runs a bit deep. I enjoy getting into the <br>
      history of certain sneaker sillohuettes, models and brands. I created a small table below to <br>
      enlighten you all on a couple of popular sneaker designs and when they were released; <br>
      I hope you enjoy and maybe we can talk sneakers and sports soon! </p>
